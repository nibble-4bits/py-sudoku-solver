# Python Sudoku Solver
A sudoku solver that uses backtracking to find the solution(s). I mainly wrote this little program to learn more about recursion and backtracking and also to improve my Python knowledge.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6 or above

## To Do
* Write a sudoku generator algorithm instead of hard-coding the sudoku puzzle
* Create a visual app that shows how the backtracking algorithm works (not necessarily in Python)
